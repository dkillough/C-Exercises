<h1>Exercises.C</h1>

A simple program to help you learn C.

<b>Instructions per-section can be found as comments adjacent to the corresponding section.</b>

Made for supplemental practice by @dkillough

Originally created for incoming CS 429 students @ UT Austin 

(**Note I had Dr. Young; Dr. Chatterjee uses slightly different material.)

Section identifiers based off of those from [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org) (Copyright n.d.)

<h2>Reference.md</h1>
Short reference guide for exercises.c. Contains useful information, especially pertaining to Computer Organization and Architecture concepts. 

<h2>Solns.c</h2>
A file to automatically check your solutions and print a result. Mostly only available for the first few problems as they're pretty simple and objectively correct/incorrect. 

Also contains example solutions for latter problems in case my instructions aren't clear

<h2> Problems? </h2>
<h3> If you need help or would like to report any issues, please post them to /issues. </h3>

Thanks!

... oh, and ignore the compile warnings if they pertain to check/solution methods for now.


<h2>//TODO</h2>

   1. Add code comments to solns.c ?
